# bikesharing

## Purpose:
The purpose of this report is to use Taleau to create a series of vizualization of a bikesharing business in NYC and use to study the possibility of opening a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

Our vizualizations will tell us:
* Total number of users,
* Type of customer subscribers vs day users,
* Time when bikes are use the most, 
* The top 10 bikes used the most 
* Trips by gender by hour, and trips by user type and gender by day of the week.
## Deliverables:
### Deliverable 1: 
* The data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format
* The DataFrame is exported as a new file without the index column (see link below)
* [NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/LucyPill/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb)

### Deliverable 2: Create Vizualizations for the trip Analysis
* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender

### Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
* Use the five visualizations that you created in Deliverable 2
* Use at least two visualizations that you created in this module
* [Challenge: NYC Bike Share Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucy.e.pill/viz/ChallengeNYCBikeShareAnalysis/NYCStory)

## Conclusion:
Our analysis clearly shows that most riders are male subscriber and they ride mostly during work-commuter hours. In order, to open a  busines in Des Moines, Iowa using the NYC bikesharing a more rigorous analysis needs to be perfomed. This analysis is good, so  at least we can get an idea of the type of subscribers, the peak hours when more bikes are needed the most and what month of the year bikes are most heavely used.
