# bikesharing

## Purpose:
The purpose of this report is to use Taleau to create a series of vizualization of a bikesharing business in NYC and use to study the possibility of opening a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

Our vizualizations will tell us:
* Total number of users,
* Type of customer subscribers vs day users,
* Time when bikes are use the most, 
* The top 10 bikes used the most 
* Trips by gender by hour, and trips by user type and gender by day of the week.
