# bikesharing

## Purpose:
The purpose of this report is to use Taleau to create a series of vizualization of a bikesharing business in NYC and use to study the possibility of opening a bikesharing business in Des Moines, Iowa.

Our vizualizations will tell us:
* Total number of users,
* Type of customer subscribers vs day users,
* Time when bikes are use the most, 
* The top 10 bikes used the most 
* Trips by gender by hour, and trips by user type and gender by day of the week.

## Results:
### Deliverable 1: 
* The data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format
* The DataFrame is exported as a new file without the index column (see link below)
* [NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb](https://github.com/LucyPill/bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb)

### Deliverable 2: Create Vizualizations for the trip Analysis
* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender

### Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation
* Use the five visualizations that you created in Deliverable 2
* Use at least two visualizations that you created in this module
